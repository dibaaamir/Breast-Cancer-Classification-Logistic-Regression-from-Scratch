# üß† Breast Cancer Classification ‚Äì Logistic Regression from Scratch (No ML Libraries)

This project implements a **logistic regression algorithm from scratch using only NumPy**, without relying on machine learning libraries like PyTorch or TensorFlow. The goal is to classify **breast cancer diagnoses** (Benign vs. Malignant) based on medical and demographic data.

## ü©∫ Project Description

Breast cancer is one of the most common forms of cancer among women globally. Early and accurate diagnosis is essential to improving treatment outcomes. In this project, we use a real dataset to train a logistic regression classifier to distinguish between **benign (non-cancerous)** and **malignant (cancerous)** tumors.

## üìÅ Dataset Overview

The dataset includes the following features:

- `Age`: Patient's age
- `Menopause`: Menopausal status (0: post, 1: pre)
- `Tumor size`: Tumor size in cm
- `Involved nodes`: Presence of metastatic axillary lymph nodes (1: present, 0: absent)
- `Breast`: Cancer spread (1: spread, 0: not spread)
- `Metastatic`: Cancer metastasis
- `Breast quadrant`: Location in the breast
- `History`: Family or personal history of cancer (1: yes, 0: no)
- `Diagnosis result`: Target variable (Benign or Malignant)

## ‚úÖ Key Features & Tasks

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing
- Loaded the dataset and removed rows with missing values  
  *(optional: predicted missing values for extra credit)*
- Converted categorical/string fields into numerical values
- Normalized numerical features for better convergence

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Visualization

  - Correlation heatmap for all features

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Dataset Splitting
- Split data into:
  - **Training Set**: 70%
  - **Validation Set**: 15%
  - **Test Set**: 15%

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Logistic Regression Implementation (from Scratch)
- Implemented `logistic_regression()` using:
